BackendIO
=========

This project allows developers to quickly set up simple backend services from within the browser.


This is an experiment. It is tailored towards front-end developers and consumers of RESTful webservices.


It has 2 main purposes.
+ Act as a stub to quickly test out functionality.
+ Bypass the complications associated with setting up simple RESTful services (Eg. CRUD opperations & Authentication)
